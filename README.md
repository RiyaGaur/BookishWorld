# BookishWorld

Bookish World Project is a MERN based project that helps in building a platform for all book readers. This platform helps users to discover new/old book titles, read their description, view their summary and like posts shared by other readers. This platform also enables users to share their own recent book titles and description which they might have read in a while. 

# Problem Statement

In this digital era where people share their hobbies like dance, music etc, there comes a need to provide an open platform to all those readers who want to explore new book titles every day and share their aspects regarding a book. This idea has led to building book-specific social media platform: Bookish World, where people can connect over poetry, literature, blogs, articles, quotes, scriptures- writings that are worth sharing.
